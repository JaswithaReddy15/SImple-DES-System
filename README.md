# Simple Data Encryption System (Simple-DES)

This is my second project in Java.
<br>
This is a very simple data encryption system that uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt and decrypt text.
<br>
The code for the AES cipher (AES.java) is taken from here https://howtodoinjava.com/security/java-aes-encryption-example/ .
<br>
I also plan to include a file encryption and decryption but there was no success.
<br>
Please feel free to correct my mistakes and update the project.
